Enter the path to your IP list file when prompted. The script will execute ./ssh-audit.py for each IP address in the list, capturing the colored output and appending it to ssh-output. Each IP's output will be separated by dashed lines in ssh-output, and the IP being processed will be printed to the terminal. After processing all IPs, it will print "SSH Audit Completed".
